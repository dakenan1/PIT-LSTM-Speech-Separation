
These Matlab scripts generate the two speaker and three speaker data used in
         John R. Hershey, Zhuo Chen, Jonathan Le Roux, and Shinji Watanabe.
         "Deep clustering: Discriminative embeddings for segmentation and separation."
          ICASSP, 2016
and later publications.
They start from Wall Street Journal corups (WSJ0) converted into wav files.
The scripts also use the voicebox matlab library, installed in the directory
      ./voicebox
Voicebox can be obtained here:
